Rope and Cloth Simulation Guide

This simulation allows you to create and interact with ropes and cloth in a physics-based environment.
The simulation offers two primary modes: Rope Draw and Cloth Simulation.

Modes of Operation
1. Rope Draw

    Cloth Sim: False
        In this mode, you are drawing a rope.

2. Cloth Sim: True

    In this mode, you are simulating cloth behavior.

Getting Started
Rope Draw Mode (Cloth Sim: False)

    Default Rope: After hitting play, a default rope will spawn automatically.
    Breaking the Rope: Hold right-click and drag over a connection to break the rope.
    Pausing the Simulation: Press the Space key to pause the simulation.
    Creating Pinned Nodes (Anchors): While paused, hold Shift and click to create a pinned node, which serves as an anchor point for the rope.
    Creating Nodes: While still paused, regular clicking will create a new node.
    Creating Connections: Click and drag from one node to another to create a connection.
    Resuming the Simulation: Press Space again to un-pause the simulation and watch the physics at work.

Cloth Simulation Mode (Cloth Sim: True)

    Default Cloth: After hitting play, a default array of nodes will spawn.
    Cutting the Cloth: The right-click functionality to cut the cloth works the same as it does for the rope.
    Creating a Cloth: Instead of spawning individual nodes, left-clicking will create a cloth. Clicking and dragging will create the cloth with the top nodes pinned.

Interaction Summary

    Right-Click + Drag: Break a rope or cut the cloth.
    Space: Pause/Un-pause the simulation.
    Shift + Click (Paused): Create a pinned node (anchor point).
    Click (Paused): Create a node (for ropes).
    Click + Drag (Paused): Create connections between nodes.
    Left-Click + Drag (Cloth Sim): Spawn a cloth.
